            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Vppon this matter roſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye grudge and hartburnyng, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes ſekynge meanes to requite Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius wyth the lyke.

There was one Preſidius a citizien of Rome who beynge wont to dwell at Rauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, in the begynnyng of thys warre ſtale awaye from thence, and came to Rome. In hys iourney the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyers of Conſtantyne whiche laye at Spolet, had taken from hym a ſword curiouflye wroughte and coſtlye ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed. The man beynge robbed and

But by meanes of the warre and of the ſyege whyche afterwarde enſewed, the ſouldyers beynge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe occupyed and the Captayne buſyed aboute weightier matters, the thynge was delayed. At the length in thys tyme (as I ſayde) whyles all thynges were in ioyfull eſtate, as Beliſarius rodde through the towne. Preſidius caughte hys Horſe by the brydle, and wyth a lowd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnynge voyce, in the audyence of a greate number, aſked hym yf it were meete that a Cytyzen of Rome (who abandonynge all that euer he had to the enemy had fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way naked) ſhuld alſo be robbed by his ſouldiers of that little y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he had caryed away w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, and be thus wrongfully

Theſe wordes dyd ſtyrre the pacience of Beliſarius verye ſore.</p>
               <p>And therfore affoone as he came home he cauſed Conſtantine to be called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hym (for they were his ſouldiers that had taken awaye the ſworde) and gaue hym a great rebuke for neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng of his commaundement ſo often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes in delyuerynge of the ſworde. Marry (ꝙ Conſtantine) I wyll rather throwe it into the Tyber, then I wyll reſtore it to that Varlet. This was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lewdly and preſumptuouſly anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Then ſayde Beliſarius vnto him, art not thou vnder me? Yes ſayd he, for as much as it is the Emperours plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But yet for all that, in this one thyng I wyll neuer be ruled by you
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:173919:73"/>whyles I lyue. When Beliſarius hard hym ſaye ſo, he was more angrye with hym then before, and called for the Serieauntes. Conſtantine kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that it ſhould be to his coſte that the Serieauntes were ſent for, drewe out his Dagger that hung at his thigh and lyke a Bedlem runnyng at Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius, and dabbed hym in a lytle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſtomacke. Out of dout yf ſuch as ſtood by, had not ſpedely ſtept vnto him, and wronge the Dagger out of hys hande, and delyuered hym to the officers, Beliſarius had ſurely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forit, and hys death had drawen all things with it to vtter ruine, &amp; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes had the ſame day bene made lords of all. But God of hys infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes woulde not ſuffer ſo great a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce to happen. And after at the commaundement of Beliſarius, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine was put to death. Within a whyle after,<note place="margin">Treaſon tvviſe detected.</note> the Gothes attempted to haue raken Rome by ſtealth, firſt by a way that they founde out in one of the
<pb facs="tcp:173919:74"/>channells of the conduites in the night tyme, and afterwarde by ſtealing ouer the ryuer in botes nere vnto the fielde of Mars. But they miſſed of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in both places. For in the channel theyr owne lyghts bewrayed theyr co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert workyng, by meaues whereof the channell was ſtopped, &amp; they encloſed from gettyng out. And at the field of Mars their treaſon was detected, &amp; ſo their attempt was made fruſtrat. The treaſon was deuiſedin this wiſe. Two raſcall Varletts that dwelte by S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters churche (the Gothes as is ſhowed before, neuer offered harme or diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to that place, but in honour of tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle preſerued bethe the buyldynges therof and thoſe that dwelled in them unhurt) had ſecret co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Vitigis of betraying y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie. And to bring theyr purpoſe to effect, they deuiſed this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:173919:74"/>tymes, truſted altogether to the defens of the Ryuer. Vitigis therfore cauſed lyghters &amp; barges and all kind of botes to be put in a readineſſe at the brydge Miluius. For had he once ſet any con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenient number of hys ſouldiers, ouer on thother ſide of the ryuer, he thought it would be an enſie matter, after the landing of the firſt, to conuey ouer ſtill mo and mo in the ſame veſſelles. He douted nothing ſo muche as that the watchmen that warded on that ſide ſhould eſcrie hym and bewray his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe. For the auryding of which dout, he corrupted the two Remaines for a piece of money, to further thys at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. To whome he delyuered a ſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping pouder willing them to geue it the watchmen with wine, to thentent that when they had dronke the ſame, they might fall into a dead ſlepe. After theſe conueances were thus deuiſed, &amp; agreed vppon, the one of them beyng ſtryken with repentance, diſcloſed the whole matter to Beliſarius, and
<pb facs="tcp:173919:75"/>there vppon the other beynge taken with the ſlepie medicine aboute hym, that the Kynge hadde geuen hym, was put to the torture and compelled to vtter all the order of the matter.</p>
               <p>The whiche done, Beliſarius cauſed his noe and eares to be cut of, and ſettyng hym vppon an Aſſe, ſent hym out at the Pincian gate to the Gothiſh Campe, to the entent that Vitigis might perceiue how that his cloſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng was detected, and his ſerret prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes browght to lyght.</p>

               <p>THe verye ſelfe ſame tyme, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius graunted an ayde of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyers to the Ambaſſadours of Millain that came before vnto Rome. He appoynted Mundilas one of hys familiar frendes a verye ſtoute and
<pb facs="tcp:173919:80"/>valiant man to be chieftaine of the ſaid armie. In the ſame band was alſo Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delis of Millaine whome we declared to haue bene Stewarde of the kynges houſe. All theſe being conueyed to Geane by ſhippe, went from thence to Millaine on foote. And to thentent they woulde not be hyndered of theyr paſſage ouer Po, they caryed Bots with them in Wagons, to ferrie ouer the ryuer withall. Marching therefore in this ſort as I haue tolde, when they had paſſed ouer the ryuer Po, and were come to the Citie Ticiuum whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch is nowe called Pauie, the Gothes iſſued out of the towne and ſet vppon them. For by reaſon that towne had a ſtrong caſtle in it, the Gothes had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed manye and precious thynges in the ſame, and had manned it wyth a great garriſon. The ſkyrmyſhe was no ſooner foughte, but that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes were dryuen into the Cytye.</p>
               <p>And ſo Mundilas paſſed wyth hys armye ouer the bridge that was harde
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:173919:80"/>by the town. In the ſame place was Fi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>delis of Millain ſtaine. For he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into a certaine church to make his prayers, and the reſidue of hys company beyng all gone, laſt of all he came out alone, &amp; as he wold haue taken hys horſeback, be ouerethrewe.

               <p>The deathe of thys man was great ſorowe bothe to the Captaine and to the ſouldyers. For he was a noble man in hys countrey, and of muche power, and ſuch a one as wyth his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence might greatly haue furthered the warre that was in hand. Mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las therefore and the reſte of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany keepynge on theyr iourney to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde Millaine,<note place="margin">Millaine and other cities of Lumbardy be come Imperial</note> were receyued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Citie.

When Vitigis had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe thinges that had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aboute Millaine, he ſent Vraias hys brothers ſonne with a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into thoſe coſts, to ſhentent he ſhould bothe cauſe ſuch to keepe theyr allegians to the Gothes as had not yet reuolted, and alſo (yf he could) recouer ſuch as had already yelded.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, he wrate to Thew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deberre Kynge of Fraunce (wyth whome not long before he had ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in leage) deſyring hym to mimiſter ayde vnto Vraias. In thys ſtate or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this expectation were the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Lunthardie. Beliſarius at ſuch tyme as corns began to ware type, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of Rome, marched wyth hys armye towarde hys enemyes. The Gothes that were left in garriſon at Tudert and Cluſe, hearing that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius was makyng towarde theym

Whyle theſe thynges were in doinge, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigis ſent another armye vnto Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum. For he was vtterlye deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myned to reteyne and kéepe ſtyll that Citye. Wyth thys armye he ſent a newe deputye to haue the charge of the Towne and the men of warre, named Varinius.

And therevppon he went wyth all hys whole power agaynſte the inhabiters of Auton.</p>
               <p>That Towne in thoſe dayes was walled onelye on that ſyde, that ſtoode vppon the hyll, the lower places ſituated on the playne grounds
<pb facs="tcp:173919:82"/>albeit they were repleniſhed with buil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dings, yet were they not encloſed with anye wall. Therefore at ſuch time as the Gothes approched. Conon captain of the towne and ſouldyers of Aucon, fearing leaſt the ſuburbes and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiters thereof ſhould be waſted and deſtroyed by thenemye, came downe from the vpper part of the towne with all his whole crewe,<note place="margin">The foole has dineſſe of Conon.</note> and ſet hymſelfe agaynſte hys enemye.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyd quickely abye hys foolyſhe hardyneſſe. For beynge not able to ſtand agaynſte ſo manye, he was at length vanquiſſhed, and beynge put to flyghte loſte the moſte parte of hys men, and the Citie it ſelfe was with much a doe hardly ſaued from taking.

And the Captayne Conon himſelfe was driuen to ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe an erigent, that he had none other waye to ſaue hys lyfe, but to be drawen vppe the wall by a lyne.

<pb facs="tcp:173919:101"/>ſuch a ſtrang thing as hath not lightly bene heard of. For as a great number of ſhippes and galeyes were comming out of Fraunce laden wyth corne and victualles makinge ſayle toward Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenna, the Riuer fell ſo lowe, that ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny of the ſhips ſtood ſtyl for want of wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter to beare them.

This was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fyrſt token of good lucke wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to further the procedynges of Beliſarius.

Theſe hyghe wordes dyd part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye puffe vp Vitigis &amp; hys Gothes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pryde, &amp; partly made them afraid. For if the Frenchmen came into Italy, it was not to be doubted that they ſhuld get the vpper hand, but it was a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culte matter to be beleued, that they would kéepe touche and play the good fellowes in parting of the Empyre.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:173919:102"/>
               <p>And therfore yf the Frenchmen ſhuld come they miſtruſted leaſt they would be as much to their confuſion as to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion of their enemies.<note place="margin">Beliſarius ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigis.</note> This doubt of theirs Beliſarius helped to increaſe.

Howebeit Vitigis was in a mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueylous miſtruſt, becauſe it could not

               <p>There are vppon the Alpes many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the which in old tyme were kept by the Gothes placed there to dwell.</p>
               <p>For Thalpes do diſſeuer Italy from Fraunce, ryſing of a wonderful hight very hard to clymb vnto or to paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the which paſſages it was expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the well kept. And therefore Theodorich kyng of the Gothes dyd hoth place a puyſſaunt company of his countrey men with their wyues and children in thoſe waſt grounds, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo buylded them caſteles &amp; holds.

The ſame tyme Vraias was in Lumbardy, muſteryng of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyers to carye wyth hym to Rauenna. He had already raiſed an army of foure thouſand men. Of the which the moſt part were inhabiters of Thalpes.</p>
               <p>Who hearyng that Siſigis was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:173919:104"/>to their enemies, &amp; that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles wherein they had their wyues &amp; children were aſſayled, they compelled Vraias firſt &amp; formeſt to lead them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

The ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours decrée was this.

When the Ambaſſadours had firſt conferred w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Beliſarius, they

And therefore anone after when the commiſſioners retourned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted him to ſubſcribe the articles he would not put to his hand. The which thing brought the Gothes in a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous maze, fearing to be deceyued vnder a counterfet pretenſe of peace.

<pb facs="tcp:173919:144"/>Beliſarius ſaid he could wel alow the ſame opinion, if the people of Rome ſtood not at ſuch an exigent. But now conſidering their eſtate, it was nedeful to make all ſpede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> might be. It was a long iourney to go through Calabre and Appulia, &amp; if their enemies ſhould mete them they might caſt many letts in their way, whereas by the ſea yf the wind ſerued, their nauie myghte w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in fiue dayes arriue in the Romaine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; by theyr beinge ſo nere at hand, putte the Romaines in certaine hope &amp; comfort. For he had heard of thunfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate miſchaunce of his captaines, &amp; knew of the loſſe of the corne that was ſent out of Sicill, wherevpon he conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his minde the deſpaire &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the Romaines were in. Thys opinion was allowed in the counſell, &amp; thervpon Beliſarius ſetting forth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dirrhachiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> arriued at Hidrunt. The Gothes which were beſieging of that towne being ſtriken with feare at the preſence of Beliſarius, brake vp their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:173919:144"/>ſiege and flying from his ſight retired to Brunduſe, the which is aboute two dayes iourney from Hidrunt. By and by they ſent vnto Totilas aduertiſing him of Beliſarius comming, beleuing that he would haue iourneyed by land. When Totilas heard that, forthwith he putte himſelfe &amp; his armye in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to goe méete hym. But when he vnderſtoode that Beliſarius went by ſea, he addreſſed hymſelfe whollye to withſtande hym aboute the Citie of Rome, ineſpecially makynge proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that nothing mighte be conueyed into the Citie to theym that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, by the Ryuer Tiber.

<pb facs="tcp:173919:146"/>This thing ſo greatly troubled, Iohn, that for feare he ſhould be entrapped by his enemies, he left of his iourney toward Beliſarius, &amp; turned himſelfe towarde the Brutians and Lucanes.

In the meane while Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius cauſed the ſhyppes wherin the tower of tymber was, to be brought as nere the tower of his enemyes as could be. And when they came hard to it he commaunded the veſſelles of brimſtone (whiche he had hanged in the toppe of hys tower for the ſame purpoſe before) to be ſet on fyre, and to be caſte downe vppon the towre of hys enemyes, the which being done, the fyre lighting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the tower of hys enemyes, burned it vp and al the Gothes that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it. There were not leſſe then two hundred that periſhed in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fyre among whom was the Captayne of the holde hymſelfe, ſuch a man of hys handes as was not among all the Gothes agayn. Hereuppon the ſouldiers aſſayling the reaſt of the Gothes more boldely and fierſly, compelled them to geue backe, wherby they wonne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brydge, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which forthwith they purpoſed to haue hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen downe, and with their whole flete

For there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned not now any let in their wayes, but that they myghte haue gone to the Citye and haue conueyed in the corne and all other neceſſaryes, to the greate renoune and commendation of Beliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, whoe had deuiſed ſuche a nauie.<note place="margin">Man purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and God dyſpoſeth.</note> But fortune (as it ſhould ſeme) had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined other wyſe. For ſodaynely there happened a wonderful miſchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (not by meanes of the enemye, but by hys owne men) which peruerted al hys deuiſes. The Gothes helde the Citye Oſtia which ſtandeth on the lefte hand of Tyher by the ſea ſyde ouer agaynſt the whiche ſtandeth the City Portua on the ryght hande of the riuer. When Beliſarius ſet forth with hys nauie, he had lefte hys wyfe and al his houſehold furniture in the ſayd towne of Portua, and had appoynted as ruler thereof one Iſaac a valiant gentleman and a truſty with a conuenient Crew of ſouldiers, commaundyng and hartely belieching him, that he would not for any chaunce
<pb facs="tcp:173919:149"/>or occaſion, depart out of the towne but kepe hymſelfe within it and defendeſt only: Now at ſuch tyme as Beliſarius had ſet hys enemyes tower on fyre (as we haue delcared before) by &amp; by ranne certayne to the towne of Portua, and whereas the victorie was notable of it ſelfe, they reported it farre greater then it was in dede. At the which tydinges Iſaac leapyng for ioye &amp; eraltyng hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in hys owne conceite, lyke a mad bedlem quite forgettyng what Beliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius had ſayd vnto hym, commaunded hys men to arme themſelues, &amp; in thys ſodayne heate &amp; extaſye wafting ouer hys men to inuade hys enemyes that kept their ſtandyng on the other ſyde of the riuer, ranne vpon them not farre from the towne of Oſtia: Through his ſodayne aſſaulte at the fyrſt encounter he put them to ſtyght. Howbeit anon after, hys enemies gatheryng themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues together and encouraging one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, returned eſtſones vppon hym &amp; hauyng ſlayne a great ſorte of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to coole hys firye madneſſe, toke
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:173919:149"/>hym pryſoner. Immeviatly hereupon certayne horſemen broughte worde to Beliſarius that his enemies had taken Iſaat prayſoner.

For ſhe hath ſuffered many myſchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which were done ſo longe a goe that they are not nowe to be recounted, and thys is not the fyrſt ruine that hath happened vnto her. Wherefore I had rather put you in remembraunce of our owne affayres. What thyng was there of grater power and ſtrength before theſe warres, then the nation of the Gothes through out all Italy? It ſent into the field two hundred thouſande fyghtyng men, throughly furnyſhed wyth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, weapons, artillerye, horſes, victualles, golde and fyluer. It holde in poſſeſſion all Italye, Sicill, Corſica, Sardinia, and Dalmatia. Who would haue beleued it had bene poſſible for
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:173919:153"/>ſeuen thouſande Grekes (for there came no mo into Italy at the fyrſt) to haue ſubuerted ſo great a power? And what ſhall we ſay of the ſame Grekes: when they had in manner brought all in ſubiection to them: and helde all as Lordes and conquerers? woulde any man haue thought that you beyng but a fewe and broughte almoſte to begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, ſhoulde haue recouered Italy out of the handes of them beyng twentye thouſand men, conſideryng that at that tyme ye were not able to make aboue foure thouſand horſemen? and had not a towne lefte you in all Italy, more then Pauye Veron, &amp;<note n="*" place="margin">Now called Treuizo.</note> Taruiſium? woulde any man haue thought that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ye ſhoulde haue taken Rome the head of the worlde? the whiche Vitigis was not able to ſubdue with hys two hundred thouſand me in a whole yeres beſiegement? Surely countryme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe thynges are very great and not a lyttle to be wondered at.</p>

               <p>Howbeit if we liſte to conſider &amp; marke them, the cauſes of theſe alterations are moſt manifeſt &amp; apparant. For as long as the Gothes executed.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:173919:154"/>onleſſe they be maintayned by Iuſtice pollicie, and payneſtakinge.

For it is a harder matter to kepe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges gotten, then to gette them, For as muche as in gettinge often tymes the cowardnes of the poſſeſſour furthereth a man more then his owne proweſſe.

The battell was cruell &amp; bloudy in all places. For on the one ſyde the Gothes fought obſtinately as men in deſpayre, &amp; on the other ſydo the ſouldiers of Narſes were aſhamed to geue place being ſo many in number as they were, in eſpecially conſyderyng that but euen the other daye they had compelled them to forſake their firſte campe, and had well me beſteged them now in the hyll which they had fled to for their refuge.

Fynallye when it was ſo darke that they coulde not ſee, the battell ceaſed, beyng begonne at the ſonne ryſyng.

But yf he woulde not graunt them thys requeſt, they ſayd they would neuer leaue figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng, as long as the breathe was in their bodyes.
